To use this app, you need to have an imgflip account.

Once you check out the project, you need to put in your imgflip credentials inside the secrets.js file. This is required to be able to get data from the imgflip API.

After you put in your credentials, just run "npm start" using the command prompt from within the root folder of the project.
